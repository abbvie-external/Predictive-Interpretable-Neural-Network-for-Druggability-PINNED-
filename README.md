# Predictive Interpretable Neural Network for Druggability (PINNED)

`PINNED` is a neural network model designed to produce druggability scores for four separate contributions to protein druggability, as well as a final superscore representing the predicted likelihood that a protein is druggable.

## About the model
The model consists of four separate deep neural networks: `Sequence and structure`, `Localization`, `Biological functions`, and `Network information`. Each subnetwork contains a single output neuron, whose scores are summed to generate an overall druggability score logit.

Prior to model training, `fpocket_pipeline.ipynb` was used to generate the protein drug pocket scores found in `fpocket_output.csv`, which were combined with other protein data stored in `raw_data`. `feature_processing.ipynb` was used to produce a single processed feature matrix, as well as a list of names of features to be inputted into each of the subnetworks, which can be found in `processed_data`. *Note that the actual feature matrix is not included here due to its size; however, it can be generated by running the `feature_processing.ipynb` notebook.*

Subsequently, `PINNED_model.ipynb` was used to train and cross-validate the model and produce scores for each of the proteins in the dataset.
